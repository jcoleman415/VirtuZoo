    Description
  </h2>
  <p class  = "words">
    A pest to ranchers, a prize to hunters, and a temperamental tank to anything that bothers it, African buffalo roam by the thousands in sub-Saharan Africa.
  </p>
  <p class  = "words">
    Cape buffalo, one of four distinct subspecies of the African buffalo, are the most common. They’re distinguished by coloring, size, and even horn shape. There’s also the forest buffalo, the West Africa savanna buffalo, and the Central Africa savanna buffalo.
  </p>
  <p class  = "words">
    When the buffalo aren’t fighting off the occasional lion, they’re eating grass—and lots of it. It forms the bulk of their diet. Like cows, buffalo chew cud to further extract nutrients.
  </p>
  <p class  = "words">
    Buffalo and bison aren’t the same animals. How the misnomer came to be is murky, but it’s thought early American settlers called bison “buffalo” because they look similar—large, brown, hulking beasts that graze—but the two animals are actually from different genuses within the bovine subfamily. A quick ID tool is looking for a beard: Bison have them and buffalo don’t.
  </p>
  <h2> Herd Lifestyle</h2>
  <p class  = "words">
    African buffalo are hardy critters, able to live and flourish in many habitats—from semi-arid bushland to coastal savannas to lowland rainforests—as long as they’re close to a water source. The ungulates are found starting in southwest Ethiopia and through Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia, and Malawi, with patchier distribution through Angola, Mozambique, and Swaziland. They’re also present in South Africa, and along the southwest coast in countries like the west African countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Benin and the southern part of Burkina Faso.
  </p>
  <p class  = "words">Buffalo are often pictured covered in mud with a bird on their back. The mud helps buffalo get rid of ticks and parasites that latch onto their skin. Birds such as oxpeckers, for example, ride on the back of the buffalo and eat lice, fleas, and other parasites while getting a lift.
  </p>
  <p class  = "words">
  Buffalo spend most of the year in herds of anywhere between 50 and 500, but that number jumps up into the thousands in the Serengeti during the rainy season. Gathering in such large groups helps dissuade predators like lions, leopards, hyenas, and African wild dogs. Older male buffalo, though, often strike out in smaller clusters or on their own. Meanwhile, calves spend up to a year and a half suckling and are completely dependent on their mothers during this time.</p>

        <h2>
          The Black Death
        </h2>
        <p class  = "words">Widespread in East and South Africa with currently nearly 300.000 animals, this species is not endangered in the wild. Large buffalos can weigh about 1000 kg and are renowned for their hot temper: as one of the “Big Five” it is also called “Black Death” and “Widow-maker”. In southern Africa, this buffalo is widely regarded as a very dangerous animal, as it gores and kills over 200 people every year! Herds stick together and help their members when in need. There are several reliable records about herds keeping lions for several hours in a tree, after these had killed a buffalo of the herd! The only serious enemy for an adult buffalo is human (…with a gun)!</p>
        <p class  = "words">Syncerus caffer caffer needs no introduction. Iconic, admired, feared. The sobriquet “black death” is understood and well-earned. But fearsome charges and unreal vitality are only part of the story of the great beast’s lethality. It is, perhaps, more dangerous for the tiny, microbial beasts that hitch a ride on, or live in, its nearly indestructible body.</p>
        <p class  = "words">The cape buffalo is a herbivorous bovine, effectively a plant-eating cow, but they are extremely aggressive and downright vengeful. Displaying perhaps a little more smarts than a typical bovine, there are numerous accounts of them using their legendary memories and extreme persistence to enact revenge upon hunters who shoot at or injure them. Cape buffalo have stalked hunting parties, hiding in wait, and ambushing their attackers.They reportedly charge thousands of people a year, and gore over 200. They can attack and cause serious injury with the tips of their huge, curved horns, or by head butting with their "boss" which is the solid shield of horn that covers the skull where the horns emerge. </p>
