  Description
</h2>
<p class  = "words">
  White rhinos and black rhinos live in the grasslands and floodplains of eastern and southern Africa. Greater one-horned rhinos can be found in the swamps and rain forests of northern India and southern Nepal. Sumatran and Javan rhinos are found only in small areas of Malaysian and Indonesian swamps and rain forests.

  <p class  = "words">
  Rhinos spend their days and nights grazing and only sleep during the hottest parts of the day. During the rare times when they aren't eating, they can be found enjoying a cooling mud soak. These soaks also help to protect the animals from bugs, and the mud is a natural sunblock, according to National Geographic.

  Though rhinos are often solitary, they do occasionally form groups. Called crashes, these groups are made up of a female and her offspring. A dominant male rules over an area of land. The male will allow some sub-dominate males to live on his territory. Females roam freely around several different territories.

    <li>A fossil skull first thought to be that of a dragon, turned out to be from an extinct woolly rhinoceros.</li>
    <li>The closest living rhino relatives are tapirs, horses and zebras.</li>
    <li> A group of rhinos is called a crash.</li>
    <li> Despite their large size, rhinos are herbivoresâ€”they only eat plant matter. They make up five of only nine remaining megaherbivore species left on Earth. Their exact diet depends on their habitat. For example, white rhinos have evolved square lips to graze on abundant grass, while black rhinos have developed pointed lips to pick leaves and plants.</li>

          Pointy Problems

        <p class  = "words">
          Rhino horns are made of keratin, which is also the key component of human hair and fingernails. But the horns are not just dense clumps of hair. CT scans have shown dense mineral deposits of calcium and melanin in the core of the horn. The calcium makes the horn stronger, and the melanin protects it from the sun's UV rays, according to scientists at Ohio University.

          The horns are similar to horse hooves, turtle beaks and cockatoo bills, said Tobin Hieronymus, an OU doctoral student. Rhino horns tend to curve backward, toward the head, because the keratin in front grows faster than the keratin in the back, Hieronymus told Live Science. The outside of the horn is rather soft and can be worn down or sharpened after years of use, according to the San Diego Zoo. If a horn breaks off, it can gradually grow back.

          Rhino poaching refers to the illegal hunting of rhinoceroses. The horns of rhinos are highly valued in traditional medicine and as status symbols in some cultures. Rhino poaching has become a major problem in recent years. In fact, some species are facing the threat of extinction. The main cause of rhino poaching is the demand for rhino horns in Asia, particularly in China and Vietnam. Even though rhino horn has no proven medicinal properties, it continues to be highly prized and fetches a high price on the black market. The increasing demand for rhino horns has led to a surge in poaching activities. This has proven disastrous for rhinos around the world.
