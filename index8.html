  Description
</h2>

    <p class = "words">
      The hippopotamus is an amphibious mammal found in the heart of Africa’s wetlands. These semi-aquatic creatures live in and around lakes, rivers, and grassland swamps. There are two species of hippopotamuses, the common river hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibious) and the smaller pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis).
    </p>
    <p class = "words">
      Hippos must keep their skin wet with mud or water for most of the day to stay hydrated. While they don’t have sweat glands, they secrete a red substance called blood sweat. This helps protect their reddish-brown, thick yet sensitive skin from sunburn and keeps it moisturized. Despite their need to spend most of their time in the water, hippos can’t swim. Instead, they run or walk along river beds. When they’re rafting—napping while submerged in water—a subconscious reflex keeps them near the water’s surface.
    </p>
    <p class = "words">
      These formidable creatures are considered the second largest land mammal, smaller only than elephants. The average male hippo can weigh around 3,200 kilograms, while females usually weigh 30% less. They’re typically 3.5 meters long and 1.5 meters tall.
    </p>
    <p class = "words">
      Hippos have bulky, barrel-shaped bodies, short and stout legs, large heads, and enormously powerful jaws. Their jaws can open to 180 degrees and bite down with three times the strength of a lion. They’re armed with impressive, sharp teeth that can grow up to 50 centimeters long, used for eating and defense. The common hippopotamus has four webbed toes adapted to support them on land and in water. On the other hand, pygmy hippos tend to have less webbing and slightly longer legs. A hippo’s eyes and nostrils sit on top of its head, which helps it stay mostly submerged in water while breathing and keeping an eye on its surroundings. Although hippos can’t breathe underwater, they can hold their breath for up to five minutes.

    <h2>
      Docile but Deadly
    </h2>

    <p class = "words">
      A lot of people ask, “how dangerous are hippos, really“? Hippos are one of the most dangerous animals in Africa, responsible for more human deaths than lions, leopards, elephants, and crocodiles combined. Despite their seemingly docile appearance, these semi-aquatic mammals can be extremely aggressive, territorial, and unpredictable, making them a serious threat to human life. In this article, we will explore just how dangerous hippos are, what makes them so deadly, and what measures people can take to stay safe in their presence.
    </p>

    <p class = "words">
      Causing an estimated 500 deaths annually (as compared to only 22 for lions), hippos are deadly land mammals. This is because they are very aggressive and territorial, and have a habit of charging at boats and capsizing them.
    </p>
    <p class = "words">
      The people on board then either drown or are killed by the animals themselves. Weighing an average of 1,500 kg (males), with large sharp teeth, it’s certainly an animal you wouldn’t want to face up against.

    <h2>
      Change in Diet
    </h2>
<p class = "words">
  Hippos are primarily herbivorous, meaning they eat only plants, but they have been observed to engage in omnivorous behavior. Live Science says hippos have a “mostly herbivorous appetite,” made up of about 80 pounds of grass each night, as well as fruits found during nightly scavenges.
      However, a 2015 study by the Mammal Review shows hippos “occasionally” feed on animal carcasses, a more omnivorous behavior. Hippos are known to attack and eat animals like wildebeests, zebras and kudus, as well as other hippos in cases of cannibalism, according to AZ Animals. They also steal meat from other predators.
