  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p class  = "words">
    African elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. They are slightly larger than their Asian cousins and can be identified by their larger ears that look somewhat like the continent of Africa. (Asian elephants have smaller, rounded ears.)
<p>
  <p class  = "words">
    Although they were long grouped together as one species, scientists have determined that there are actually two species of African elephants—and that both are at risk of extinction. Savanna elephants are larger animals that roam the plains of sub-Saharan Africa, while forest elephants are smaller animals that live in the forests of Central and West Africa. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature lists savanna elephants as endangered and forest elephants as critically endangered.
  </p>
  <p class  = "words">
    African elephants are keystone species, meaning they play a critical role in their ecosystem. Also known as “ecosystem engineers,” elephants shape their habitat in many ways. During the dry season, they use their tusks to dig up dry riverbeds and create watering holes many animals can drink from. Their dung is full of seeds, helping plants spread across the environment—and it makes pretty good habitat for dung beetles too. In the forest, their feasting on trees and shrubs creates pathways for smaller animals to move through, and in the savanna, they uproot trees and eat saplings, which helps keep the landscape open for zebras and other plains animals to thrive.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Trunks and Tusks
  </h2>
  <p class  = "words">
    Elephant ears radiate heat to help keep these large animals cool, but sometimes the African heat is too much. Elephants are fond of water and enjoy showering by sucking water into their trunks and spraying it all over themselves. Afterwards, they often spray their skin with a protective coating of dust.
  </p>
  <p class  = "words">
    An elephant's trunk is actually a long nose used for smelling, breathing, trumpeting, drinking, and also for grabbing things—especially a potential meal. The trunk alone contains about 40,000 muscles. African elephants have two fingerlike features on the end of their trunk that they can use to grab small items. (Asian elephants have just one.)
  </p>
  <p class  = "words">
    Both male and female African elephants have tusks, which are continuously growing teeth. Savanna elephants have curving tusks, while the tusks of forest elephants are straight. They use these tusks to dig for food and water and strip bark from trees. Males, whose tusks tend to be larger than females', also use their tusks to battle one another.

        <h2> Big Body, Big Brain</h2>
        <p class  = "words">Elephants are highly social animals, living in tight-knit family groups called herds. Their social intelligence is outstanding, as they display empathy, cooperation, and an understanding of complex relationships. They hold the ability to recognise and remember individual elephants, even after long periods of separation.</p>
        
        <p class  = "words">One of the most renowned cognitive abilities of elephants is their long-term memory. They have an impressive recall of geographic locations, water sources, and migration routes that can span vast distances. Their memory allows them to navigate and find resources essential for their survival. Furthermore, elephants can remember specific individuals within their species and across different species, which contributes to their social dynamics and interactions.</p>

        <p class  = "words">Elephants demonstrate resourcefulness and outstanding skills to solve problems. They have been observed using tools such as branches to swat flies or scratch themselves. When faced with challenges, elephants are quick to apply their problem-solving abilities. For example, elephants at our centres are given complex feeder enrichments to sustain their inherent skills. They showcase their talent by successfully solving these puzzles to retrieve food rewards hidden in the structures! Their cognitive flexibility and ability to strategise are worth admiration.</p>
        <h2>Three Forms, One Animal</h2>
        <p class  = "words">
          It’s true! While most people assume there are only two—Asian and African—there are actually three: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Forest elephants are smaller than bush elephants at about half the size and their tusks are straighter and downward pointing while African bush elephants have more curved tusks. Both evolved from a common ancestor and have distinctly different DNA.
